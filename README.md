# 📖 About the Project

This project is designed to showcase Python OOP principles in a practical and interview‑ready way. It focuses on writing clean, modular, and maintainable code using classes and objects.

The goal is to help learners:

- Understand core OOP concepts clearly

- Apply OOP in real‑world scenarios

- Prepare for Python technical interviews

# 🧠 OOP Concepts Covered

✔ Class & Object
✔ Constructor (__init__)
✔ Encapsulation (Data Hiding)
✔ Inheritance
✔ Polymorphism
✔ Abstraction (using abc module)
✔ Method Overriding
✔ self keyword
✔ Class vs Instance Variables

# ⚙️ Getting Started
Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above

Installation
# Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-oops-project.git

# Navigate to project folder
    cd python-oops-project

# Run the project
    python main.py

# ▶️ Usage

- Modify or extend classes in models.py

- Add new features using inheritance

- Test polymorphism by overriding methods

This structure allows easy scalability and clean separation of concerns.

# 💡 Code Example

    class Animal:
       def speak(self):
            raise NotImplementedError("Subclass must implement this method")

    class Dog(Animal):
       def speak(self):
             return "Dog barks"

    obj = Dog()
    print(obj.speak())

# ✅ Best Practices Followed

- Meaningful class and method names

- Single Responsibility Principle

- Proper use of access modifiers (_ and __)

- Modular and readable code

- Interview‑friendly design patterns


# 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add unit tests using unittest or pytest

- Convert project into a package

- Add logging

- Improve exception handling
